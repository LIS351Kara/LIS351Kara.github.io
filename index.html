	<h1>The Life of Kara Dunton</h1>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Kara Dunton and I am from Oconomowoc, WI.</p>
		<p>I am currently a junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison double majoring in Marketing and Management with a Digital Studies Certificate. I made a podcast last year called "The Flying Phone" which was featured on the UW-Madison Digital Studies Youtube page. It was about my unique and interesting experience getting my phone stolen on a plane and the journey I took to get it back.
