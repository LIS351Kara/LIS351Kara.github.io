	<h1>Education</h1>

	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Growing up, I attended school through Oconomowoc Area School District K-12. I then decided to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in which I am currently on track to graduate in May 2022. I received admission to the Wisconsin School of Business and I am double majoring in Marketing and Management with a Digital Studies certificate. 


	<h2>My Dream Job</h2>
	<p>When someone asks me what my "dream job" is, I have a pretty hard time answering because I have always thought of multiple career paths. I am a pretty indecisive person and could see myself in many different places in the next 10 years. Here is just a few of my ultimate career paths I would LOVE to have. 
		<ul>
			<li>Working at a News Station as a Marketing/Creative director</li>
			<li>Working at a Digital Marketing agency</li>
			<li>Working for a large company or organization in the Marketing department</li>
			<li>The final "dream" goal: to create my own business</li>
		</ul>
